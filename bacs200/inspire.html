        What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to.
        Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as
        role models says a lot about who we are as people.
                                        -Mark Seaman

        The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unfathomably generous - they give freeley and without expectation</li>
        <li>Motivate others - people flock to those who have good to share</li>
        <li>Average-sized footprint - Keanu wears a size 10, nothing too crazy</li>
        <li>Care for the little people - they do not act as if they are above others</li>
        <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        With these requirements in mind there is no one who fits the bill more than Keanu Reeves himself.
        He is a genuinely fantastic person and the internet is constantly flooded with nothing but love
        for this breathtaking man. He has brought smiles to countless faces, and yet still he stays humble
        in the face of those very fans who adore him so. He gives heartily to the needy, shows compassion
        to all, and is deeply invested in the joy of what he does. Keanu Reeves is truly an inspiration to
        us all.
