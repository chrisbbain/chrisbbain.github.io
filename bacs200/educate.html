How is this move — which is called a fouetté — even possible? Arleen Sugano unravels the physics of this famous ballet move.  </th>

          <th>  The kinds of social change that cost the winners of life are ruled out. This ultimately leads to problems like 82% of wealth accumulated on 2017 went to the global 1 percent. This puts these types of people in such an unfair advantage that some people are struggling to keep their head above water. Ultimately the best solutions aren’t asking that 1 percent to get off of someone’s back to even the playing field. In order to have social change we have to work together and stop feeding the win win fantasy that allows the winners to stand on other people’s backs. </th>

Climate change was seen as a problem that would take decades to fully unfold but that actually isn’t the case as it happened within years in real time. The little time we have to solve this problem could lead to greater problems down the road that would affect all life. Depending how bad it gets will be up to us and in what we do.

          <th> The majority of the work force in 2012 reported there were not happy with their current job. Technology in this case is part of the reason for these workies being unhappy/disengaged as being unable to use technology to its fullest potential decreased productivity. Another reason is the work environment provided doesn’t help promote productivity. Putting people in small cubical isn’t a great environment to work in. Lastly to increase productivity you need to have a culture that promotes productivity by surrounding your employees with good people.  </th>
